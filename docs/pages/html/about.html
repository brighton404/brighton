      <article class="about-card"><h2 class="heading-h2">My passion in design</h2><div class="paragraph-span-container"><p class="paragraph-span">In the dynamic realm of design, my life unfolds as a tapestry woven with pixels and purpose. From the moment I stumbled upon the captivating world of UI design, I found my true calling-a fusion of artistry and functionality that resonates with the heartbeat of users. <br><br> From my background UI & UX designers & digital artists are all considered as graphic designers, and the society at large doesn’t know about every design layer that is archivable. I found out that its not just about crafting visually appealing interfaces; it was about making technology seamlessly integrate into people's lives. What hooked me was the power to solve problems, and create experiences that leave an indelible mark. Each project becomes a new canvas, and every interaction is an opportunity to connect with users on a profound level. The incessant pursuit of perfection, the thrill of bringing concepts to life, and the ever-evolving landscape of design are the driving forces that fuel my passion. <br><br> UI design isn't just a profession; it's a journey of discovery, innovation, and the joy of turning imagination into reality. </p></div>

      <article class="about-card"><h2 class="heading-h2">Rugby career</h2><div class="paragraph-span-container"><p class="paragraph-span">For me, is not just a game. Thanks to my father who was a seasoned rugby player, I was naturally drawn to the sport that shaped my early memories, growing up to the deafening sound of cleats on the field. I was inspired by watching one world cup season when i was still a kid. <br><br> What keeps me interested is the relationship among teammates, the symphony of training, and the strategic plays between opponents. The rugby field is my proving ground, where i go out and relieve myself from my daily activities. Career-wise, the sport isn't merely a pursuit; it's a dedication to surpass limits, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. In every scrum and sprint, I find a testament to an enduring legacy in my lifetime.</p></div></article>
