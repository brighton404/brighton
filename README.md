## Portfolio Webpage

This project showcases my portfolio, design work and skills. Whether you're a potential employer, collaborator, or just an enthusiast, I hope you find inspiration and insight into my creative process here. 

## Blog Page

Blog structure is written in markdown. It doesnt rely on API to fetch blogs rather reads all blogs from the directory `/content` present in the src directory. <br/><br/>
The data is read and displayed by using a query module that scans the directory and reads raw data of files saved in markdown format. To display the data the markdown must contain a header e.g
```md
---
title: Getting Started with React: A Beginner's Guide
date: 2024-10-10
author: Julius Brighton
categories: [1, 3]
---
```
This header is read first as packets that make the markdown file a blog, that means any file within the directory that is a markdown file but does not contain this header it won't be identified as a blog file.
